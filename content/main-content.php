   <h1>Welcome</h1>
   <p> Hi, Welcome to my website. My name is Venkat Annangi. I live in Irving,TX. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering 
   from from India. I work as a ERP Consultant specializing in Oracle Financials/Manufacturing. I have been working in this field for 
   the last 15 years. In addition to working with Oracle Databases, I have also experience with Java and some web programming. </p>
   
   <p> I am currently taking a course with Harvard Extension School taught by Susan Buck. The course is Dynamic Web Programming using 
   PHP and mySQL. I have applied for ALM in Information Technology Degree program and taking this course to satisfy elective requirements.
   I am looking forward to learning the PHP scripting language, database design and dynamic programming using PHP and mySQL.</p>

   	   
   <p>I have experience working with COBOL, Pascal, Fortran, C and C++ during my college days. I have not used any of these languages in 
   last 10 + years. I have taken Web Programming course in last semester and have learned HTML and CSS.</p>
   
   <p> I am using a Mac. I have a MacBook Pro 13" i7.</p>
   
   <p> I am building a web application and have thought about using Python or Ruby in building it. But, due to the popularity and the number 
   of websites running PHP, I have choosen to take this course. </p>
