            <h2 class="content-subhead">In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am a Venkat Annangi. I live in Irving,TX and I work as a IT Consultant primarily in the field of ERP (Oracle Financials/Manufacturing). I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. I do enjoy watching sports and watch Basketball, Football and Tennis.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Why are you taking this course?</h2>
            <p>
                I am working on developing a Web Application. I have explored many technologies and finally decided to use PHP as the preferred language. I have also applied for ALM in Information Technology degree program after completing 4 course with a CGPA of 3.83. I am taking this course to satisfy Elective and also to get my hands on the scripting language so it can help with my web application.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
            <p>
                My programming experience is very little. I have learned COBOL, FoxBase, Pascal, Fortran and C during my college days but have not used since then. I haven take few programming classes at Harvard Extension in Java and Web Programming.            </p>


            <h2 class="content-subhead">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
            <p>
                I work with Mac. I recently purchased a Macbook Pro 13" and love it.
            </p>
 
            <h2 class="content-subhead">Anything else we should know?</h2>
            <p>
                I am looking forward to learning Dynamic Web Applications and very excited. In addition to the topics covered, I would also like to see a lecture on scaling websites. A section on famous PHP frameworks ( pro's and con's ) would be helpful.
